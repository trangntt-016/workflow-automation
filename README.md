# Workflow Automation

Basically, these are scripts I've written to automate tedious tasks in my daily programming. All parts of all scripts were written by me, unless otherwise stated.

These scripts work for me, and I hope they will either work for you as-is. If you do find issues, though, please send me a pull request and I'll try to incorporate any fixes you come up with.
